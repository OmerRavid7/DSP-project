# DSP-project
reduce noise from a signal

In this project you get a signal, The signal is made out of a 
desired signal and a very strong noise signal.

The signal sampled at f=5KHz.
  
# HOW it works
# step 1:
read the signal and plot it in time
# step 2:
Plot the spectrum of the input signal and I found what are the noise frequency
# step 3: 
design a 2nd order notch filter that block the strong noise signal
plot a pole-zero diagram of the notch filter and also plot the absolute value of the frequency response of the filter.
# step 4:
pass the signal through the filter and plot in time
# step 5: 
pass the output through a threshold detector. (Positive values are 1 and negative values are 0)
to get clean signal
